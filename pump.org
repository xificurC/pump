* Pump

A utility for working with sets of files

** Philosophy

Write a pipeline of commands, each taking the results of the previous command.
The commands execute lazily, requesting new values from the previous one as needed.

** Usage

$ pump :glob **/*.org :filter % :resolve :length :< 10 % :set-extension bar
